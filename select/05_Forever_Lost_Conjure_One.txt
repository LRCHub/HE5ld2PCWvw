So many times
So many promises
Heard all the lies
I've heard all the things you've said
Truth is like a fear; fear of heaven
Truth, your only fear; fear of heaven
And now I don't know
The highs and lows
Give me something
Forever lost in all I try
Give me something
So hard we try
Sold on your promises
Laid on the line
Lay out the trauma there for me
Truth is like a fear; fear of heaven
Truth ain't always clear; clear like heaven
And now I don't know
The highs and lows
Give me something
Forever lost in all I've tried
Give me something
And now I don't know
How much I show
All the wrong things
Forever lost in all I try
We're after the same thing
And I don't know
The highs and lows
Give me something
Forever lost in all I try
Give me something
Give me something...
