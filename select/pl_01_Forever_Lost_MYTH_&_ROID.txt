Each time that I lose something precious,
I know that there may never be an end to
The price that we pay for our dreams
It can never be repaid
To carry on is to carry a burden,
Even if it's too much to bear, I won't turn back
In the white light, we're praying for the lost
For our grief, for our pain
To the white light, we're praying for the lost
So we try to find solace, empty hands together
In the white light, we're going down this road
For our hope, for our fate
To the white light, we're going down this road
My journey has to go on with you
In the white light, we're praying for the lost
To the white light, we're praying for the lost
I'll take all of your wishes and your dreams
In your place, in memory
Give me all of your wishes and your dreams
I'll take all that you left
and realize it for you
In the white light, we're going down this road
For our hope, for out fate
To the white light, we're going down this road
My journey has to go on with you
We will remember the days
Our past will live on forever,
as we strive towards our future
The sadness never disappears,
it just becomes a part of us, deep inside
