Every day it's still the same
I don't know what to do with my life
I don't know where I belong to

Every night it's still the same
I wake up crying from my dreams
I have these nightmares again
All these past visions

People hate God, people hate God

I'm asking me, should I pray?
Or does nothing really make sense?
Is there someone watching over me?

Does anybody care about my life?
Can anybody rescue my soul?
Will I be damned forever more?
Or will there be a light at the end?

(I want to serve the darkness, I refuse the light)

Will I go to Heaven, will I go to Hell?
Will there be a life after death?
Or will I be, will I be
Will I be forever lost?
Will the darkness take control me?
Do I have to serve the Devil?
Should I try to remain holy?
Should I regret my sins?
(Let the darkness take control of me
I want to serve the Devil
I don't want to be only like you
And I will not regret my sins)
